It's march 16th, and as such we're celebrating the 2 year anniversary of Hyprland!

I wanted to thank all of you for the continued support on this project. Hopefully we'll
get even more cool stuff done over the next 2 years and beyond!

I've dropped hyprland 0.37.0 which you can find [here](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/releases/tag/v0.37.0),
which includes tons of fixes and new features, like hyprcursor, layer animations,
many desktop components rewritten for better stability and much more :D

The hyprland ecosystem is growing, maybe we'll get a hyprDE soon? haha. Unless?

Now it's your turn to bug your local packager to update hyprland :P

Cheers
