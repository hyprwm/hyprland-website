Hello there, it's your overlord speaking.

Recently, I've made some big changes to how our issue tracking works. The reason was simple: the
issue tracker was a dumpster. Tons of bad, stale, incomplete, etc. issues. It was _unmaintainable_.

I've pondered at the solutions I had, and I've also made a poll amongst you to vote on what you'd
like to see as the solution. Ultimately, the approach Ghostty took won, and I am also quite in favor of it.

Essentially, you create a discussion instead of an issue, and once that discussion has enough attention,
information, and is confirmed, it can be promoted to an issue. That means that all the things in the issue
tracker are instantly actionable, as they are well-understood and confirmed.

I know it might seem weird to close 1.3k issues just like that, but trust me, most of them are bad.

For once, 70% of them were marked as stale. Commenting on a stale issue removes the tag, and yet **_70%_** were
stale, meaning it was very likely nobody gave a damn.

Secondly, it's a good opportunity to take a reset, and get rid of dupes. There are many issues duped.

Thirdly, we can now tag issues properly, which will make it easier to track and categorize.

I know it puts a bit more work onto the user, but that's the point! You, as a user, spending 5 more minutes is nothing,
but for us, those 5 minutes per user cascade into hours and hours of boring work that sucks the energy out of
us that we could've spent on the actual important thing... writing code, you know.

At any rate, I hope this change helps us write better code, and write it faster.

Cheers,
vax.
