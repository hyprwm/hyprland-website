Hello everyone!

As it's been not much of a secret anymore, Hyprperks has been a few months in the making,
and now it's all come together.

Hyprperks is now open to purchase to everyone!

If you want to support the development for 5â‚¬ + tax a month, and also get a few goodies from us,
please check out [the pricing page](https://account.hypr.land/pricing)

You will get:

- Member-only forum access, with dev Q&A, support from me, and more
- Premium desktop experience, which is a set of preconfigured dotfiles with a one-click install and update
- And of course, support the continued development.

If you don't have a Hyprland Account yet, consider making one! It's free, and gives you access to our public forums,
where you can find answers, ask questions, and interact with the community.

Also, thank you for all the support, guys. You are awesome!

Cheers,
vax.
