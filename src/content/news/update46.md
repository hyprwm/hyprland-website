Whoo! Just before Christmas, we've managed to get 0.46.0 ready for you!

## Breaking changes

Some stuff has changed:

### Nvidia Hardware cursors!

`cursor:dumb_copy` is now gone in favor of `cursor:use_cpu_buffer`. This should allow no-downsides Nvidia hardware cursors. Please note it's experimental.

### Window/layer rules

Window/layer rule regexes now require a full match (not any match) to trigger.

For example, in the case of `jeremy`:

- `jeremy`: OK
- `^(jeremy)$`: OK
- `jer`: Used to match, now won't. You'll need to do `.*jer.*` to make it act like before. (Consider _not_ doing that though, make a better regex.)

## New stuff

Tons of new stuff, you can think of all of these as Christmas presents.

- Color handling has been moved to OkLab from sRGB. This means gradients and color transitions will now look more natural.
- XWayland Drag and Drop is back! You can now drag stuff from your Wayland clients to X11 clients.
- New update screen! Whenever you update, you'll get a small popup reassuring everything went well and reminding you to check the release notes.
- Window and layer rule handling has been improved and optimized, and regex handling is now done via RE2 from Google, which is faster and generally better.
- `cursor:warp_on_change_workspace` now accepts `force` to bypass `cursor:no_warps`.
- hyprctl: `clients` got `inhibitingIdle`, `monitors` got `directScanout`, `plugins list` got `-j` support.
- `cursor:warp_back_after_non_mouse_input` added, allowing you to keep touch / tablet input from messing with your mouse input.
- `lockdead_screen_delay` has been added if your lockscreen can't appear fast enough to avoid the "lockscreen dead" from flashing for a moment.
- You can now blur IME popups with `decoration:blur:input_methods`
- Version requests now also show linked versions of hypr\* deps.
- New windowrules for mouse and touchpad scroll factors.
- Added some new festive splashes for xmas and new years :)
- And more!

## Fixes

As always, tons and tons of fixes. See the github release to read up more.
